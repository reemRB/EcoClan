# EcoClan is a website for recycling. 
People have to separate their garbage in their home then contact us through the website to come for pick up. 
All they have to do is register online to create an account, answer few questions about the trash they want to send, 
and wait for someone to pick it up or choose to deliver at a pick-up point.
As a reward for their participation the users receive points in their accounts and when they reach a specific number of points, they’ll receive a gift. 
Doing so, will boost people’s encouragement to recycle more and participate in saving the environment they live in.
