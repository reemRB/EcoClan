    <p style="fontfamily:'times new roman'; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Some alternative methods were used, in javascript specifically such as onmouseout and onmouseover instead of hover since we needed javascript to dinamically implement our idea.
    Other than that, since we needed to save some of the inserted user's information to be used for other parts on other pages and instead of using databse we used the localStorage object that can send the information from one page to another.
    We tried to minimize the use of the alternatives as much as possible, so when it was necessary and there was no other way to implement our idea except when using them, we applied those methods.

    In order to get an idea of how to use the methods we went through different references which are: <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOe0ysNsNCo"> localStorage</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiiXLmqhndU">onmouseout and onmouseover</a></li>

    </ul>  </p>
